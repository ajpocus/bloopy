# KABLAM

_Turns whistling into MIDI_

## Installation

First, you'll want `pipenv` installed, which is outside the scope of this README. Please refer to [the pipenv documentation]()

## Note

This is a highly experimental work in progress. You might have to adjust certain parameters to get it to work for you, and the result isn't going to be perfect.
